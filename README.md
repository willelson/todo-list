# Todo list

This work in progress will be a CRUD todo list that will consume a restful flask api I am also currently working on.


### Install and run

First install [node package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) if you don't already have it. 

The next step is to install bower: 
```
npm install -g bower
```
Install required packages from package.json
```
npm install	
```
Install angular & angular-mocks from bower
```
bower install
```
Now it's ready to run using your preferred method. I like to use npm [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/live-server). 


## Running the tests

This application is tested using karma jasmine. To run the tests
```
karma start app/js/test/karma.conf.js
```
